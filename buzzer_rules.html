    <h1>Skulls and Roses Rules (Regular Deck Version)</h1>
    <p>
        Skulls and Roses is a game of bluffing, deduction, and daring. This version uses the red and black cards 
        from a standard deck of playing cards to represent roses and skulls, respectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each player receives 4 cards: 3 red cards (Roses) and 1 black card (Skull).</li>
        <li>Players hold their cards face down and may not reveal their cards to others.</li>
        <li>Each player also has a token or marker to track their victories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        Be the first player to successfully complete two challenges by flipping over a declared number of cards without revealing a Skull.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Players take turns, proceeding clockwise.</li>
        <li>On your turn, place one card from your hand face down in front of you. You may add additional cards in subsequent turns.</li>
        <li>Once all players have placed at least one card, players may place another card face down, or start bidding:
            <ul>
                <li>The first player to bid the number of cards they think they can flip over without revealing a Skull.</li>
                <li>Other players may raise the bid or pass. If you pass, you cannot bid again this round.</li>
                <li>The highest bidder attempts the challenge.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The highest bidder must flip over the declared number of cards, starting with all of their own cards.</li>
        <li>If they succeed (only revealing Roses), they win the challenge and gain 1 victory token.</li>
        <li>If they fail (reveal a Skull), they lose one of their cards permanently, chosen randomly by the player who owned the revealed Skull.</li>
        <li>Players may not reveal their remaining cards to others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of the Game</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The first player to win 2 challenges wins the game.</li>
        <li>If a player loses all their cards, they are eliminated.</li>
    </ul>
