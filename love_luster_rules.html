    <h1>Love Letter Rules (Regular Deck Version)</h1>
    <p>
        Love Letter is a game of deduction, risk, and luck. This version allows you to play 
        with a regular deck of cards, including the 6-player expansion with Spies.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shuffle the deck and deal 1 card to each player. Place one card face down as the "Burn Card" (not used in the round).</li>
        <li>For 2 players, deal 3 additional cards face up to the center (also not used).</li>
        <li>The remaining deck becomes the draw pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        Be the last player standing or have the highest-ranked card in hand when the deck runs out.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On your turn, draw a card and play one of the two cards in your hand.</li>
        <li>Resolve the effect of the played card immediately.</li>
        <li>The effects of each card are listed on the reference card.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of the Round</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the deck runs out, all players reveal their cards. The highest-ranked card wins.</li>
        <li>If all but one player is eliminated, the remaining player wins.</li>
        <li>The winner receives a token of affection. The first player to earn a set number of tokens wins the game:
            <ul>
                <li>2 players: 6 tokens</li>
                <li>3 players: 5 tokens</li>
                <li>4 players: 4 tokens</li>
                <li>5-6 players: 3 tokens</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
