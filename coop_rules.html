    <h1>Coup Rules (Regular Deck Version)</h1>
    <p>
        Coup is a game of bluffing, deduction, and strategy. This version uses a regular deck of cards, 
        replacing the original characters with playing cards as outlined in the reference card.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove all cards except the ones listed in the reference card table. There are 3 copies of each card for a total of 15 cards in the deck.</li>
        <li>Shuffle the deck and deal 2 cards to each player. These are their influence cards and should be kept face down.</li>
        <li>Each player starts with 2 coins. The remaining coins form the "Bank."</li>
        <li>Place the deck face down in the center to form the draw pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        Be the last player standing by eliminating all other players’ influence cards.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On your turn, take one of the following actions:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Income:</b> Take 1 coin from the Bank.</li>
                <li><b>Foreign Aid:</b> Take 2 coins from the Bank (can be blocked by "4").</li>
                <li><b>Coup:</b> Pay 7 coins to force a player to lose one influence. (If you have 10 coins, you must Coup.)</li>
                <li><b>Character Action:</b> Use the action of a card in your hand or bluff by pretending to have it. See the reference card for actions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If a player challenges your action, reveal the relevant card. If you can’t, you lose one influence.</li>
        <li>Discard revealed cards face up and draw replacements as necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of the Game</h2>
    <p>
        The game ends when only one player has influence cards remaining.
    </p>
